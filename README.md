# tesla_clone
Made a clone of landing page of Tesla website. 

The page is mobile view Friendly that is responsive and optimised for diffrent browsers such as firefox,safari etc.

Implemented the feature of snap scroll on the page meaning when scrolled to diffrent models on the page after certain level of scroll that product will automatically occupy the whole page thus no need to fit that section on screen using scrolling
